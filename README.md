## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a severe autoimmune disease that disproportionately affects females 9 times more than males, with the highest prevalence among Black females. SLE is characterized by diverse clinical presentations and outcomes and myriad immunological abnormalities. This diversity is particularly prominent within the B cell and autoantibody compartments and is most accentuated in Black patients with severe disease. Yet, there are still major gaps in knowledge to understanding the different types of SLE clinical disease. 

Our overall goal is to elucidate how heterogeneity within the B cell and Plasma Cell compartments contribute to clinical heterogeneity in Black patients with SLE. Our studies will be conducted in a unique cohort of Black SLE patients from the American South using large cohorts comprised of rural and urban patients that receive care at Emory University (Atlanta, GA), the University of Alabama at Birmingham (Birmingham, AL), and the Medical University of South Carolina (Charleston, SC). 

The knowledge gained from our studies will greatly enhance our understanding of SLE pathogenesis and of the contribution of different responses to separate clinical manifestations, outcomes and therapeutic responses.  Moreover, it will enable clinical investigators to more precisely design and evaluate clinical studies and standard of care treatments with the ultimate goal of implementing safer and more effective personalized treatments.  

## Types of analysis <a name="analysis"></a>
This repository provides an insight into the bioinformatics framework and platform created for standardizing data collection, analysis, and storage to ensure compatibility and reproducibility across the program. The repository is divided into sections to capture the data warehouse, derived data analysis, and data exploration. Data landscape overview outlining the workflow and data warehousing structure.
